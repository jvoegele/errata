## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Breaking:** `new/1`, `create/1`, and `raise/2` now raise an `ArgumentError`
  when given unrecognized param keys instead of silently ignoring them. Only
  `:message`, `:reason`, and `:context` are accepted. Callers that previously
  relied on extra keys being dropped will need to remove them. (#3)
